The following is an essay written as I applied to university in 2019/2020.

///

*Tell us about something that is meaningful to you and why. (100 to 250 words.)*

You. Yes, you.

By this point, you’ve reviewed hundreds--if not thousands--of applications. You’ve boiled each down to a simple, binary decision: “rejected” or “accepted.” And then, you’ve moved on.

I don’t mean to sound accusatory. I get it--there’s no goldilocks way to review 47,451 applications. But please, allow me to phrase what I’ve said just slightly differently.

By this point, you’ve decided if hundreds of life-long friendships will ever begin. You’ve decided whether marriages will ever take place. You’ve determined the futures of thousands of teenagers.

Again, I don’t intend to criticize. It’s simply an inconvenient truth.

But if there’s one thing I’ve learned in my seventeen short years on this planet, it’s that giving a damn matters. Each of us, no matter how loud or how quiet, has a story to tell--and while it’s easy to ignore them, it’s much harder to listen. But we have to listen. Because the moment we stop giving people a voice is the moment humanity ceases to be human.

So what’s meaningful to me? Listening to those stories--each and every one.

I hope I can trust you to say the same.
