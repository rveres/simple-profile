Currency: I highly recommend having Yen in cash. Japan has become much better with accepting credit card payments in recent years. QR code payments are quite limited to Japanese providers (i.e. LINE pay/PayPay), so I do not recommend counting on them. Larger stores will accept credit cards, and most smaller places should as well. Sometimes, however, they may not, which is when cash comes in handy. For reference, a typical non-fancy meal should cost about 800-1000 yen, a Shinkansen ticket may cost around 15000 yen, depending on the size of the journey. Please also see the note about IC Cards (PASMO/Suica) in the next section. 

Transport: Of course, there is the Shinkansen, which is very convenient but can get quite pricey. Check out if there is a JR rail pass that suits you: https://japanrailpass.net/en/about_jrp.html, since you can save quite a bit of money. Sometimes, picking up the Japan Rail Pass can be a bit tricky, since the office can be hard to find in a big station. Though the English is not great, if you dedicate enough time to it, you can eventually find your way to the office to pick up the pass. If you are buying a ticket, I recommend going to the physical counter to buy it, as there are 2 parts: the basic fare ticket and the additional journey/fare ticket. In my experience, sometimes the automated machine will give you only the basic fare ticket, so you end up standing in line anyways. If you say your departing station and the destination station, they will know what to do. The ticket system for Limited Express trains generally works the same way. Some trains (most in the North) require seat reservations on specific trains; otherwise, if you buy an unreserved ticket, you can travel on any train in the unreserved section for which you have purchased the ticket within the time frame (generally 24 hours). If you can, try to avoid buying or picking up tickets at huge stations like Shinjuku or Tokyo station, because they are absolutely crazy. 

I still recommend buying an IC Card to get around, either PASMO or SUICA. These two work anywhere in the country and make life much easier. You can buy them at the automated machines in metro stations (you will see PASMO or the Suica penguin, the SUICA symbol) for a ~500 yen deposit (you can go the station clerk and get this deposit back before you leave). This card is rechargeable with cash at the same type of machines and can be used just about anywhere (train/bus/etc), and even as a form of payment in restaurants, stores, etc. (in some sense, it is like the Japanese version of a credit card). 

It may also be worth checking out airplane tickets via a cheap carrier such as JetStar/Peach/Skymark, since they can sometimes be cheaper than Shinkansen (but not great if you are taking baggage). 

Accommodation: Generally speaking, accommodations are excellent in Japan (they provide towels, toothbrushes, anything you need). I almost always booked mine a few days in advance via Booking.com. If you’re going to a very small town (such as one on the Nakasendo trail, for example), you may have to look for places on Google Maps and find their webpage and call to make a reservation (this is very rare, however). I will note that some cities (Sendai in the North, for example), may not have as much accommodation available, and space can fill up earlier. 

You can stay in traditional Japanese “hotels,” or ryokans—prices can go as high as you want, depending on how much you want to be pampered. These ryokans typically have onsens/spas/saunas and can also provide meals (more traditional set meals). In some places, the bath may be in the form of a small onsen (no showers, instead there is a collective onsen-style bath, and you shower before and after). 

Capsule hotels provide good facilities, but they can get cramped after a day or two. They are always clean and provide everything you need for a short stay. 

Baggage: If you have large baggage and don’t want to deal with it, you can ship it via one of Japan’s shipping services called Yamato: https://www.kuronekoyamato.co.jp/ytc/en/send/services/takkyubin/. This service quite literally never has delays, and it is great for shipping bags to the airport; you can drop the bags off at the local Yamato Transport counter (you could also do it at the convenience store, but you need the waybill filled out, which is difficult to do when you are just visiting). They guarantee delivery in 2 days to anywhere in Japan for a reasonable price (~3500 yen for a big bag). 

Weather: It will be summertime, so expect high humidity and heat. Also, it may be a bit rainy, but you can always get a good umbrella for cheap in any convenience store (you will see everyone carrying the stereotypical clear Japanese umbrella on a rainy day). 

Miscellaneous: 

- Japanese convenience stores (7/11, FamilyMart, LAWSON) are amazing. They have meals if you are out very late and all the restaurants are closed, snacks, drinks, clothes—anything. They are also open 24/7 (literally, they never close, even for holidays). 

- Japanese restaurants are also open late (izakayas may go until 2-3 AM). 

**Places/Trip Recommendations** (Main recommendations italicized) 

For three weeks, it is probably best to do the usual trip through Japan, starting in Tokyo and then moving down to Kyoto/Osaka and then moving further south to Hiroshima and possibly Kyushu. There are some great recommended trips for this time period online (such as this one: https://thenavigatio.com/3-week-japan-itinerary/), although I think a place like Kobe isn’t absolutely essential; I have placed my recommendations and notes below. 

- Hokkaido, Northern Honshu (Tohoku) 
    - These places are not as dense, so you will probably pass by here. However, there are some small places with nice places to view. 
    - Sapporo and Hakodate in Hokkaido are more laid back with some nice views. 
    - Akita, Aomori, and Morioka each have a few landmarks and are amazing in the wintertime. 
    - Yamagata and Fukushima have some great natural sights and landmarks (Naruko Onsen, Yamadera Temple). Sendai is also the main city in Tohoku and is more laid back than Tokyo. 
    - Again, you will probably pass by this area, but if you want more information, I am more than happy to provide it. 

- *Tokyo* (of course). Enough has been said by online posts; also, it is worth just walking around to get a feel for the city. 
    - Shinjuku/Shibuya are the “big city” feel; they can also get a bit crazy for me 
    - Akihabara: any kind of fan group you can imagine; the “edgy” part of Tokyo 
    - Harajuku, Meiji shrine, and Yoyogi Park are also nice, just a bit touristy 
    - Tokyo station is in the old imperial palace and makes for some fantastic pictures with the skyscrapers in the background 
    - Ginza/Yurakucho/Shimbashi is more “upper-class” Tokyo and close to Tokyo station. This is where all those famous sushi places and high-end Western clothing stores are located. It is great to walk around and take it in. *This is one of the best places to get omakase sushi*: many places are quite pricy (in the range of 20000-50000 yen per person), but it is worth going once on your visit. Appointments are generally taken at least a month in advance, usually by phone. For the best ones, check out a list like this: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiNmrqky8D_AhVKgf0HHcvpAuEQFnoECAkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjw-webmagazine.com%2F7-best-sushi-in-ginza-from-kyubey-to-sukiyabashi-jiro%2F&usg=AOvVaw2qItohp22X1y7V8R8s5PXf. Then, go to the website to book or to find the phone number to make a reservation. Again, try to make a reservation as soon as possible. 
    - Asakusa/Tawaramachi/Sensoji temple: great place to buy the famous Japanese knives, although the shrine can get a bit crowded at times. 
    - Check out recommendations online of course, these are just the places I liked to hang around. 

- Day trips from Tokyo 
    - *Hakone*: great onsens (Japanese spas)—note that many prohibit tattoos. You will want to buy/rent a small onsen towel before you go in. Some onsens can be quite strict about formalities; I recommend looking up the etiquette, etc. online. Hakone is where people who live in and around Tokyo go for their relaxing escape. 
    - Kawaguchiko: One of the famous five Fuji lakes, it has some spectacular views. This is best to go by car, however. 
    - *Enoshima/Kamakura*: A great place to view a beautiful coastal sunset on a clear day and to see the Kotoku-in. 
    - Yokohama: Japan’s second largest city and basically just part of the greater Tokyo area. It is nice to walk around the harbor, and the food can be somewhat less expensive (there are some great izakayas here). 

- Central Japan 
    - You probably will only pass through here on your journey, but here are some notable places. 
    - Kanazawa and Ishikawa prefecture: amazing sea food and history. Kanazawa has a great market for fresh sea food (uni, or sea urchin, as well as clams and just about any fish or eel you can think of). There is a great samurai district and many historical places you can check out as well. For a day trip, Shirakawa-go is quite nice (just a bit hard to reach—but the bus ride there gave me some of the most incredible views I have ever seen in Japan) and full of history. Toyama in the surrounding area is also nice. 
    - Nakasendo Trail: the old trail from Kyoto to Tokyo and maybe the favorite trip I did in Japan. I hiked with a friend from Nakatsugawa near Nagoya all the way to Matsumoto. The main attractions are post towns like Magome-juku, Tsumago-juku, and Narai-juku, which can also be visited by car. Here is a great video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q-Y6Dtuj7U. 

- Western Japan 
    - *Kyoto*: No matter how much time you spend here, you will not be able to see all of it. This is traditional Japan at its best, and enough has been said online that I cannot really say more. 
    - *Osaka*: Tokyo’s little brother, so to speak. The vibe is completely different (people are much friendlier and more laid back). Like Tokyo, it is worth just walking around; there is also great food here (like Takoyaki, or fish balls). 
    - *Nara*: land of the deer and some impressive landmarks. There is not as much to do compared to Kyoto, but it is so close that it is worth a visit, just to see the friendly deer. 

- Southern Japan 
    - Okayama: this is on the Shinkansen down to Hiroshima, so it may be worth the stop to check out the Okayama Castle and the big garden. 
    - *Hiroshima*: A lot of history, but since the city was completely rebuilt, it also feels more modern. For the landmarks, I recommend going online. A great day trip is Itsukushima/Miyajima, the island which has friendly deer and the very famous shrine that appears to float on the water. It can be accessed by a short ferry ride for which you can use your IC card. 

- Shikoku 
    - I did not get here on my travels, but Shikoku is best experienced by car. There is a very old trail of many temples, as well as some incredible natural sights across the island. Kagawa prefecture especially is known for some amazing sights, especially of the sea. You can also see the smaller islands and the big network of bridges that looks quite fantastic. 

- Kyushu 
    - This island is right below Honshu, and it is more laid back than places in Honshu such as Tokyo. It has some great food and great onsens; just anticipate the heat and humidity, especially in the summertime! 
    - Fukuoka: Kyushu’s big city. You can find some good food here, and it is worth looking around for a day. 
    - Nagasaki: a lot of history for many reasons: the atomic bombing, as well as the Dutch trading posts and presence of Christians. I quite love Nagasaki, since the vibe is much more 1980’s “old” Japan (be careful, the bus drivers can get quite crazy, however). 
    - Beppu/Oita: Widely known as having the best onsens in Japan. If you go to a ryokan (traditional Japanese “hotel”), you can also have some amazing views as well. 
    - Kumamoto: the city has some nice landmarks and is a great way to check out the large national park around Aso-san, a big volcano. 
    - Kagoshima: the southernmost big city in Kyushu: there is a lot of history here as well, and the background is a bit separated from the rest of Japan, since there was a different ruling clan (the Satsuma clan). You can see some amazing traditional Japanese architecture, as well as a great view of Sakurajima, another volcano. In a small town about 1,5 hours by an old diesel train from central Kagoshima is also my favorite onsen: https://www.kagoshima-kankou.com/for/attractions/10674. Admittedly, it takes about a whole day to reach, but for the sand bath and the amazing view of Sakurajima, I think it is worth it.
