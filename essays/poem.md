The following is a poem composed for my AP English Literature and Composition class when I was a senior in high school. An analysis follows the poem.

Five Feet Under

I am your distant past, and binding fate;
You trample me without the slightest thought,
Then purge the trace I try to leave, irate.
But flee my grasp forever you cannot:
The life you cherish, seek to always keep,
Will cease with me, eternal bed of sleep.

I know not why the human mind, naive
In such dismay accepts the truth: your friend
I am, have been. I cared for Adam, Eve,
And nourished those from whom you now descend.
As nothing past, or present, future lays
Unseen beneath intense, persistent gaze.

Indeed, the ground beneath your feet is stained,
By blood and tears of those you held so dear;
The wives, the mothers, fathers lost--ordained
To live, to die, succumb to timeless fear
Of being nothing more than grains of dirt,
A speck of dust to soil your grandson’s shirt.

So build that coffin, leave that body rest;
With grave now finished, all you cared for gone,
The trek begins. Your flesh is mine, the chest
Secures you not from fate for life foregone.
Escape is futile, cede to present state,
I am your distant past, and binding fate.

Among the most terrifying aspects of human nature involves the end of one’s life--indeed, the conclusion of their existence. Although constructs such as religion have attempted to quell the alarm permeating the concept of death, its inevitability cannot be denied. In *Five Feet Under*, Robert Veres utilizes perspective, metaphors, and form to establish mortality as a harrowing yet fundamental element of human life that cannot be escaped.

Perhaps the single most notable feature of the poem involves Veres’ use of perspective, which serves to strengthen the notion of the certainty of death. From the beginning, it becomes clear that the true speaker of the poem is not the author himself but rather the dirt humans “trample. . .without the slightest thought, / Then purge the trace” (2-3) of when it soils their clothes and skin. In writing from this perspective, the author gains the ability to communicate with the reader as if he were the very material into which all humans eventually decompose; thus, the “I” in the poem almost appears to be death itself speaking. Not only does writing from this unique point of view heighten the innate terror sparked by considering the end of one’s life, but it affords Veres the ability to emphasize the event as a certainty. When he mentions “the ground beneath your feet” (13), he draws a parallel between the unwavering presence of the dirt--the poem’s speaker--and death in the reader’s mind. In doing so, Veres once again stresses the inescapable reality of human mortality.

As the poem progresses, the use of metaphors magnifies the fear invoked by the loss of one’s life and reinforces the notion that it simply cannot be eluded. In the first stanza, for example, the poem’s speaker, “me” (6), labels itself as the “eternal bed of sleep” (6); in other words, the dirt itself is equated to the reader’s final resting place. This simple truth highlights what is likely the most frightening aspect of death--that is, one day, the reader, like all other humans, will end up as the poem’s title says: “Five Feet Under” the ground. With one’s presence erased, it is only a question of time before one’s legacy is also eliminated. This realization is continued in the third stanza when Veres labels “the wives, the mothers, fathers lost” (15) as “nothing more than grains of dirt, / A speck of dust to soil your grandson’s shirt” (17-18). Through this comparison, Veres accentuates the chilling fact that regardless of one’s stature and accomplishments, death is a certainty. Additionally, the metaphor directly contradicts the gloriousness with which the end of one’s existence is praised: everyone ultimately transforms into mere dirt--or a nuisance “to soil your grandson’s shirt.”

Finally, Veres employs form--both through meter and rhyme scheme--to complete the portrayal of mortality as a fundamental element of the human existence that cannot be escaped. By adhering to an iambic pentameter meter throughout the poem, the work’s own rhythm retains a consistency that reflects and amplifies the predictability of death. Therefore, as the reader progresses through the work’s length, their recognition of this regularity in form parallels the realization that the end of one’s existence implies the mere reduction of human life to dirt--which in this case addresses them directly as the poem’s speaker. In addition to complementing this uniformity, the ABABCC rhyme scheme allows Veres to draw parallels that further underscore the human alarm at death and its inevitability. In the third stanza, the rhyme between “stained” (13) and “ordained” (15) serves to reiterate the fact that humans are all predestined to become the seemingly useless dirt that solely “stains” following their death. This inescapability with which loss of life is characterized is continued in the final stanza’s rhyme between “rest” (19) and “chest” (21); here, “chest” retains two interpretations, both as a “coffin” (19) and a component of the human body. Thus, the rhyme emphasizes that just as one’s body will eventually lie motionless in a grave, so will their breast after their heart has stopped beating. When considered in conjunction with meter, the rhyme scheme furthers the poem’s depiction of the end of one’s life as a disturbing truth that cannot be evaded.

Ultimately, Veres’ use of perspective in tandem with metaphors and form taps into the fundamentally human dimsay with which death is considered.
