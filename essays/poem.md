Five Feet Under

I am your distant past, and binding fate;
You trample me without the slightest thought,
Then purge the trace I try to leave, irate.
But flee my grasp forever you cannot:
The life you cherish, seek to always keep,
Will cease with me, eternal bed of sleep.

I know not why the human mind, naive
In such dismay accepts the truth: your friend
I am, have been. I cared for Adam, Eve,
And nourished those from whom you now descend.
As nothing past, or present, future lays
Unseen beneath intense, persistent gaze.

Indeed, the ground beneath your feet is stained,
By blood and tears of those you held so dear;
The wives, the mothers, fathers lost--ordained
To live, to die, succumb to timeless fear
Of being nothing more than grains of dirt,
A speck of dust to soil your grandson’s shirt.


So build that coffin, leave that body rest;
With grave now finished, all you cared for gone,
The trek begins. Your flesh is mine, the chest
Secures you not from fate for life foregone.
Escape is futile, cede to present state,
I am your distant past, and binding fate.
